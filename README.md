# GitHashingExercise
This repository hosts a collection of scripts and programs developed as part of a coding exercise related to Git, hashing algorithms, and signal handling in C programming. The primary components include:

Hash Script (hash_script): A script that takes a 4-digit integer as input and outputs its hash using a standard hashing algorithm (like SHA-256). This demonstrates basic hashing operations and script creation.

Signal Handling in C:
mysigcatch.c: A C program designed to catch the SIGINT signal, demonstrating basic signal handling in C.
mysigcatchmodified.c: An enhanced version of the above program with a custom signal handler, illustrating more advanced concepts in signal handling and C programming.

The project serves as an educational tool for understanding basic concepts in software development, including version control with Git, scripting, and signal processing in C.
